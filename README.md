The Bible Study App

This site was created to help users learn the Bible and build a more intimate relationship with God. It allows you to read the Bible and if a verse sticks out to you it also allows you to create template based journal entries based off the verse chosen

My motivation behind creating this app was my recent conversion to Christianity, the Bible is such an intimidating book to tackle and i never really understood how to read it or even where to begin so i figured why not create something that would help me with that.

This site is apart of my Portfolio project using Sinatra to run the server and elements of Ruby to code. 

To begin using this site you should run localhost:9393 on your browser as well as run shotgun in your vs code terminal.

If you have any questions or suggestions please feel free to comment them.
